# FarmTest

**F**actor-**A**djusted **R**obust **M**ultiple **Test**ing

## Description

The **FarmTest** library implements the **F**actor-**A**djusted **R**obust **M**ultiple **Test**ing method proposed by [Fan et al., 2019](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2018.1527700). Let *X* be a *p*-dimensional random vector with mean *&mu; = (&mu;<sub>1</sub>,...,&mu;<sub>p</sub>)<sup>T</sup>*. This library carries out simultaneous inference on the *p* hypotheses *H<sub>0j</sub> : &mu;<sub>j</sub> = &mu;<sub>0j</sub>*.
To explicitly caputre the strong dependency among features, we assume that the data vectors *X<sub>i</sub>* that are independently drawn from *X* following a factor model: *X<sub>i</sub> = &mu; + Bf<sub>i</sub> + &epsilon;<sub>i</sub>*, where *f<sub>i</sub>* are the common factors, *B* denotes the factor loading matrix, and *&epsilon;<sub>i</sub>* are idiosyncratic errors. Specifically, we consider three different scenarios with (i) observable factors, (ii) latent factors and (iii) a mixture of covariates and latent factors. Assume *f<sub>i</sub>* and *&epsilon;<sub>i</sub>* are independent and have zero means. The number of hypotheses *p* may be comparable to or considerably exceed the sample size *n*.

FarmTest implements a series of adaptive Huber methods combined with fast data-driven tuning schemes to estimate model parameters and construct test statistics that are robust against heavy-tailed and/or asymetric error distributions. Extensions to two-sample simultaneous mean comparison are also included. As by-products, this library also contains functions that compute adaptive Huber mean and covariance matrix estimators that are of independent interest.

## Main updates of version 2.0.0

The FarmTest method involves multiple tuning parameters for fitting the factor models. In the case of latent factors, the algorithm first computes a robust covariance matrix estimator, and then use the eigenvalue ratio method ([Ahn and Horenstein, 2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA8968)) along with SVD to estimate the number of factors and loading vectors. It is therefore computationally expenstive to select all the tuning parameters via cross-validation. Instead, the current version makes use of the fast data-driven tuning scheme proposed by [Ke et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01520), which significantly reduces the computational cost.

## Installation

`FarmTest` is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FarmTest), and it can be installed into `R` environment using the command:

```r
install.packages("FarmTest")
```

## Functions

There are five functions in this library:

* `farm.test`: Factor-adjusted robust multiple testing.
* `print.farm.test`: Print function for `farm.test`.
* `farm.mean`: Tuning-free Huber mean estimation.
* `farm.cov`: Tuning-free Huber-type covariance estimation.
* `farm.fdr`: FDR control given a sequence of p-values.

## Getting help

Help on the functions can be accessed by typing `?`, followed by function name at the `R` command prompt. 

For example, `?farm.test` will present a detailed documentation with inputs, outputs and examples of the function `farm.test`.

## Examples

First generate data from a three-factor model *X = &mu; + Bf + &epsilon;*. The sample size and dimension (the number of hypotheses) are taken to be 50 and 100, respectively. The number of nonnulls is 5.

```r
library(FarmTest)
n = 50
p = 100
K = 3
muX = rep(0, p)
muX[1:5] = 2
set.seed(2019)
epsilonX = matrix(rnorm(p * n, 0, 1), nrow = n)
BX = matrix(runif(p * K, -2, 2), nrow = p)
fX = matrix(rnorm(K * n, 0, 1), nrow = n)
X = rep(1, n) %*% t(muX) + fX %*% t(BX) + epsilonX
```

In this case, the factors are unobservable and thus need to be recovered from data. Assume one is interested in simultaneous inference on the means with two-sided alternatives. For a desired FDR level *&alpha;=0.05*, run FarmTest as follows:

```r
output = farm.test(X)
```

The library includes a `print.farm.test` function, which summarizes the results of `farm.test`: 

```r
output
```

Based on 100 simulations, we report below the average values of the true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR) and false discover rate (FDR).

| TPR | FPR | FDR |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| 1.000 | 0.002 | 0.031 |

In addition, we illustrate the use of FarmTest under different circumstances. For one-sided alternatives, modify the `alternative` argument to be `less` or `greater`:

```r
output = farm.test(X, alternative = "less")
```

The number of factors can be user-specified. It should be a non-negative integer that is less than the minumum between sample size and number of hypotheses. However, without any subjective ground of the data, this is not recommended.

```r
output = farm.test(X, KX = 10)
```

As a special case, when we set number of factors to be zero, a robust test without factor adjustment will be conducted.

```r
output = farm.test(X, KX = 0)
```

In the situation with observable factors, put the *n* by *K* factor matrix into argument `fX`:

```r
output = farm.test(X, fX = fX)
```

Finally, as an extension to two-sample problems, we generate another sample *Y* with the same dimension 100, and conduct a two-sided test with latent factors.

```r
muY = rep(0, p)
muY[1:5] = 4
epsilonY = matrix(rnorm(p * n, 0, 1), nrow = n)
BY = matrix(runif(p * K, -2, 2), nrow = p)
fY = matrix(rnorm(K * n, 0, 1), nrow = n)
Y = rep(1, n) %*% t(muY) + fY %*% t(BY) + epsilonY
output = farm.test(X, Y = Y)
```
 
Robust mean and covariance matrix estimation is not only an important step in the FarmTest, but also of independent interest in many other problems. We write separate functions `farm.mean` and `farm.cov` for this purpose.

```r
library(FarmTest)
set.seed(1)
n = 1000
X = rlnorm(n, 0, 1.5)
huberMean = farm.mean(X)

n = 100
d = 50
X = matrix(rt(n * d, df = 3), n, d)
huberCov = farm.cov(X)
```

## Remark 

This library is built upon an earlier version written by Bose, K., Ke, Y. and Zhou, W.-X. ([GitHub](https://github.com/kbose28/FarmTest)). Another library named `tfHuber` that implements data-driven robust mean and covariance matrix estimation as well as standard and *l<sub>1</sub>*-regularized Huber regression can be found [here](https://github.com/XiaoouPan/tfHuber).
